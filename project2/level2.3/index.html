    <h1>The Orange</h1>
    <p>
        At lunchtime I bought a huge orange— <br />
        The size of it made us all <em>laugh.</em> <br />
        I peeled it and shared it with Robert and Dave— <br />
        They got quarters and I had a <em>half. </em> <br />      
    </p>
    <p>
        And that orange, it made me so happy, <br />
        As ordinary things often <em>do</em> <br />
        Just lately. The shopping. A walk in the park. <br />
        This is peace and contentment. It’s <em>new.</em> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        The rest of the day was quite easy. <br />
        I did all the jobs on my <em>list</em> <br />
        And enjoyed them and had some time over. <br />
        I love you. I’m glad I <em>exist.</em> <br />
    </p>
