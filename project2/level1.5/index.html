    <h1>The Orange</h1>
    <p>
      At lunchtime
      <ul>
      <li>I bought a huge orange-</li>
      (The size of it made us all laugh.)
      <li>I peeled it and shared it with Robert and Daveâ€”</li>
      (They got quarters and I had a half.)
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And that orange, it made me so happy, <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As ordinary things often do <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Just lately. The shopping. A walk in the park.<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is peace and contentment. Its new.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the day was quite easy.
      I did all the jobs on my list
      And enjoyed them and had some time over.
    </p>

Im glad I exist.<br />
