    <h1>The Orange</h1>
<strong>At lunchtime I bought a huge orange—</strong>
The size of it made us all laugh.
I peeled it and shared it with Robert and Dave—
<em>They got quarters and I had a half.</em>

<strong>And that orange, it made me so happy,</strong>
As ordinary things often do
Just lately. The shopping. A walk in the park.
<em>his is peace and contentment. It’s new.</em>T

<strong>The rest of the day was quite easy.</strong>
I did all the jobs on my list
And enjoyed them and had some time over.
<em>I love you. I’m glad I exist.</em>
