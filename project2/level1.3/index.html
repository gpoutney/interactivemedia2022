    <h1>The Orange</h1>

    <p>
      <h2>At lunchtime I bought a huge orange- </h2>
      <h3>The size of it made us all laugh.</h3>
      <h4>I peeled it and shared it with Robert and Daveâ€”</h4>
      <h5>They got quarters and I had a half.</h5>
    </p>

    <p>
      And that orange, it made me so happy, <br />
      As ordinary things often do <br />
      Just lately. The shopping. A walk in the park.<br />
      This is peace and contentment. Its new.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <h5>The rest of the day was quite easy. </h5>
      <h4>I did all the jobs on my list </h4>
      <h3>And enjoyed them and had some time over.</h3>
      
    </p>

    <h2>I love you.</h2>
    <h2>Im glad I exist.</h2><br />
