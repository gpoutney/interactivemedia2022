    <h1>The Orange</h1>
    <p>
      At lunchtime
      <ul>
      <li>I bought a huge orange-</li>
      (The size of it made us all laugh.)
      <li>I peeled it and shared it with Robert and Daveâ€”</li>
      (They got quarters and I had a half.)
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      And that orange,
      <ul>
        <li>it made me so happy,</li>
        (As ordinary things often do)
      </ul>
       <br />
      Just lately. 
      <ul>
        <li>The shopping.</li>
        <li>A walk in the park.</li>
        <li>This is peace and contentment.</li>
        (Its new.)
      </ul>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the day was quite easy.
      <ul>
        <li>I did all the jobs on my list</li>
       <li>And enjoyed them and had some time over.</li> 
      (I love you. Im glad I exist)
      </ul>
    </p>
